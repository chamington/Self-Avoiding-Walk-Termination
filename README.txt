This is a repository dedicated to finding the amount of steps until a termination in various self avoiding walks
What this means is that I have a program that goes a radom direction.  Once the path is in a position where it can't go any further, by being surrounded by an existing path (itself) it terminates, and the length is recorded
I'm not sure if there is a proof that there will be a termination for a lattice in a dimension greater than 1, but I assume it is
